# Cash Counting Application â€“ Product Requirement Document

## Overview
The Cash Counting Application is a desktop tool built with **Electron** to assist users in counting physical U.S. currency. It will run on **Windows, Mac, and Linux**, with the initial release focusing on **Windows MSI installer packaging**. The application provides a simple interface for inputting counts of bills and coins, calculates the total, and generates a printable/exportable report.

## Purpose
This application helps users quickly total the value of physical U.S. currency, including both bills and coins. It ensures accuracy in manual cash counts and provides a formatted report for recordkeeping.

  - Printed directly to the **default system printer**  
  - Exported to **PDF**  

### Application Behavior
- Always starts with blank fields (no persistence of previous data).

- Minimal, clean UI similar to a calculator.  
- Optional **keyboard shortcuts**:  
  - `Ctrl+P` for Print  
  - `Ctrl+E` for Export to PDF  
  - `Ctrl+C` for Calculate

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Calculation and report generation must complete in <1 second for typical inputs.  
- Security: No internet access required; no data storage on disk.

2. Windows MSI installer.  
3. Documentation for installation and usage.
